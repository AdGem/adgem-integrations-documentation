## Introduction
The Offer API allows publishers to pull offers and display them natively on their website or app. This integration type can be used in a variety of UIs and works especially well for featured placement sections. The Offer API returns all offers (both single and multi-reward) by default, along with goal-related data and a unique ID for each offer.

The Offer API returns all available offers and allows publishers to control sorting and targeting of offers for their players.

The Offer API is not designed to be called in real-time client scenarios.

We recommend you call our API every 5 minutes to ensure your players have access to the most up-to-date offers. If your app is polling the API more than 60/min this will result in an error. NOTE: Offers may return to the feed after they have been removed due to day capping/temporary pausing.

## Authentication
The Offer API offers two forms of authentication:
  - API Key
