  Partial: Postback Macros Table
  Usage: import PostbackMacrosTable from '@site/docs/_partials/postback-macros-table.mdx';
         <PostbackMacrosTable />
*/}

The following macros are available for use in your postback URL. AdGem's server will replace these with actual values when sending the postback.

:::info URL Encoding
All field values are URL encoded using **PHP `rawurlencode()` RFC 3986** (which differs from JavaScript encoding). For example:

A `{campaign_name}` of `Example App: Sports & Casino - CPE FTD (iOS, INCENT, Free, UK)` will be returned as `Example%20App%3A%20Sports%20%26%20Casino%20-%20CPE%20FTD%20%28iOS%2C%20INCENT%2C%20Free%2C%20UK%29`

:::tip Best Practices
- **Include `{payout}`** - Track the accurate decimal revenue earned for each conversion
- **Include `{goal_id}`** - Track player progress on multi-reward offers (each goal has a unique ID)
- **Alphabetize parameters** - Some frameworks sort query strings, so alphabetizing avoids authentication issues
