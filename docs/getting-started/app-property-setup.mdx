# Create an App Property in AdGem

Before AdGem can populate offers for your users, you need to create an App Property in the AdGem Dashboard. This page walks you through the setup process.

## Prerequisites

- An active [AdGem Publisher Account](https://dashboard.adgem.com/register)
- Basic information about your app (name, platform, category)

## Interactive Setup Guide

Follow along with our interactive demo to set up your App Property:

import CreateAppProperty from '@site/docs/_partials/sdk-step0-create-app.mdx';

<CreateAppProperty />

## Manual Setup Steps

If you prefer step-by-step written instructions:

### 1. Access the Dashboard

1. Log in to the [AdGem Publisher Dashboard](https://dashboard.adgem.com/publisher/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Properties & Apps** in the sidebar

### 2. Create a New Property

1. Click **Add New Property**
2. Enter your app details:
   - **App Name** - The name of your application
   - **Platform** - iOS, Android, or Web
   - **Category** - The category that best describes your app
   - **Store URL** - Link to your app on the App Store or Google Play (if applicable)

### 3. Configure Settings

After creating your property, you'll receive:
