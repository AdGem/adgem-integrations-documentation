## Best Practices

### Web Offerwall Integration

:::tip iFrame/WebView Best Practices
For Publishers integrating the AdGem Web Offerwall via an iFrame or WebView:

- **Ensure the iFrame or WebView is scalable** according to device resolution
- **Include a header image or divider** to clearly indicate where your site ends and the offerwall begins
- This helps your users understand what actions to take and improves navigation
- Makes the AdGem offerwall better match with your native UI
:::

### API Integration

AdGem allows Publishers to pull offers and display them natively on their website or app. This integration type works especially well for featured placement sections.

:::tip Native UI Best Practices

**Confirm user is eligible for the offer shown**

We recommend that you receive [Install Postbacks](/docs/webhooks). Once you receive the install postback, check off the install to confirm that the user is eligible to continue the offer to receive rewards.

Common reasons a user may not be eligible:
- The user has previously completed or downloaded the offer
- The user is ineligible due to incorrect geo or device targeting

**Track goal progression based on postbacks**

The user should be able to see in your UI when a goal has been completed.

**Show remaining days to complete an offer**

Each offer in the API response includes an `attribution_window_days` value. Use this to dynamically show users how many days they have to complete the offer.

**Follow up with users regarding their progression**

Engage with users through in-app messaging or external channels (email, SMS, push notifications) to encourage them to complete in-progress offers. This provides achievement recognition and motivates users to engage with additional offers.
