## Monetization Tips on Leveraging Rewards to Drive Player Engagement

### Showcase the AdGem Offer Wall When Players Need Virtual Currency the Most

For example, after a player experiences an in-game failure or when their virtual currency balance is too low to make a purchase. Another example is after a player has abandoned an in-app purchase—this moment does not have to be lost. Rather, match the player intent with a potential reward from the AdGem Offer Wall.

### Give an Extra Reward for Repeated Engagement

Present a special reward to a player to promote repeat engagement with the AdGem Offer Wall. For example, a small bonus reward that a player can collect daily for opening the AdGem Offer Wall or when a player has completed offers on consecutive days.

### An Unforgettable Rewarding Experience

The point of a game is to have fun, so why not make the AdGem Offer Wall part of that experience? Many developers are utilizing both the AdGem API and the AdGem Offer Wall to weave their rewarded ad strategy into the actual gameplay, making it something that players engage with and look forward to.

After a user has completed an offer, this conversion event could unlock exclusive in-game content that is otherwise unavailable. For example, a scratcher ticket, spin-the-wheel, or treasure chest is unlocked after the player has engaged with a rewarded offer. What is unique in your game where you can try this same approach?

## Customize the Offer Wall to Your Brand

One of the unique things about the AdGem Offer Wall is the ability for publishers to customize the Offer Wall to match the color and style of their game for any season, promotion, or occasion. Developers can easily customize the Offer Wall header, background color, button colors, and virtual currency icons and name.

To learn more about customization options, please visit the [Offer Wall Customization](/docs/configuration) documentation.

## Utilize Smart Segmentation

### By Level

Depending on your game, it may make sense to show the offer wall once a player has reached a certain level.

### By Paying Users or Total Spent

A common way for developers to segment is by paying users vs non-paying users, where developers may only expose certain ad formats to players based on whether the user has made an IAP or purchased beyond a certain amount.

### By Custom Events

With the AdGem SDK, you can define the ad unit placement on the session start or once a user has engaged with a specific ad. By measuring the performance of the ad unit by placement you will have the needed data to optimize when and where you should place the ad unit for best performance.
