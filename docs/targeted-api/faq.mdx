# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does the default sorting work in the `offers` query?

When the `sort` parameter is not provided in the `offers` query, the system applies a default sorting mechanism designed to balance offer performance and visibility for new entries.

### How it Works

The default sort prioritizes performance but strategically places new offers to ensure they receive exposure:

1.  **Primary Sort:** The offers are initially ordered by their **`network_epc` in descending order** (highest EPC first).
2.  **New Offer Insertion:** Offers marked as "New" (which typically have an EPC of 0) are removed from the bottom of the list and **re-inserted starting at position 5**.
3.  **Final Order:** Existing offers that were ranked 5th and below are pushed down to accommodate these new insertions.

This approach guarantees that all offers, whether new or established, get a chance to be seen by users.

### Visualization of Sorting

Below is an example illustrating how a set of offers is transitioned from the initial state to the final, displayed order.

#### Before Sorting (Initial Data)

This represents the raw data order before processing.

| Position | network\_epc | Is New? |
| :------: | :----------: | :------: |
| 1        | 0.15         | No       |
| 2        | 0.25         | No       |
| 3        | 0.08         | No       |
| 4        | 0.00         | Yes      |
| 5        | 0.19         | No       |
| 6        | 0.00         | Yes      |
| 7        | 0.12         | No       |
| 8        | 0.05         | No       |

#### After Initial EPC Sort

Offers are sorted strictly by `network_epc` (descending). New offers (EPC 0) fall to the bottom.

| Position | network\_epc | Is New? |
| :------: | :----------: | :------: |
| 1        | 0.25         | No       |
| 2        | 0.19         | No       |
| 3        | 0.15         | No       |
| 4        | 0.12         | No       |
| 5        | 0.08         | No       |
| 6        | 0.05         | No       |
| 7        | 0.00         | Yes      |
| 8        | 0.00         | Yes      |

#### Final Order After New Offer Insertion

The two "New" offers are strategically placed at positions **5** and **6**, pushing the previously ranked offers (0.08 and 0.05 EPC) down to positions 7 and 8.

| Position | network\_epc | Is New? |
| :------: | :----------: | :------: |
| 1        | 0.25         | No       |
| 2        | 0.19         | No       |
| 3        | 0.15         | No       |
| 4        | 0.12         | No       |
| **5** | **0.00** | **Yes** |
| **6** | **0.00** | **Yes** |
| 7        | 0.08         | No       |
| 8        | 0.05         | No       |

## How does translation fallback work?

The translation fallback mechanism is designed to prevent failures and ensure localized fields are always returned, even if a specific translation doesn't exist. This process follows a simple, three-step hierarchy.

This is best illustrated when a language with a specific dialect, such as **Traditional Chinese for Taiwan (`zh-TW`)**, is requested:

1.  **Specific Language and Dialect:** The system first attempts to translate the field using the full language code, including the dialect (`zh-TW`).
2.  **Base Language:** If the specific dialect translation is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to the base language code (`zh`).
3.  **Default Language:** If the base language translation is also unavailable, the system defaults to the global fallback language, which is **English (`en`)**, ensuring a value is always provided.

This multi-step approach ensures a graceful degradation of the translation, prioritizing the most specific language available.
